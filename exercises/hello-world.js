// Hello, World!

// When using JSX React needs to be in scope. This means you have to import it.
import React from "react";

// Unlike working with HTML, the building blocks of our UI are not global. Therefore we need to
// import them.
import { View, Text } from "react-native";

// TIP: A component is simply a function from which we return JSX.
const App = () => {
    return (
        <View
            style={{
                justifyContent: "center",
                alignItems: "center",
                backgroundColor: "lightblue", 
                height: 100,
                width: 100,
            }}
        >
            <Text>Hello World!</Text>
        </View>
    );
};

// TIP: Components can nest and have children. <View><Text></Text></View>

// TIP: Styling happens via the style prop. That style, in it's most basic form, is simply an
// object. style={{ ... }}

// We need to export App/Component so it's rendered on the screen. To work in this example app you
// need to use export default. Dont' worry about this right now, we'll talk about it later.
export default App;
